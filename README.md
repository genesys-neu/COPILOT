# # COPILOT: Cooperative Perception using Lidar for Handoffs between Road Side Units

This repository contains the Python codes that enable vehicles to proactively select the most suitable mmWave RSUs (Road Side Units) for high-bandwidth, low-latency communication. It leverages cooperative perception between vehicles by sharing intermediate Lidar features instead of raw point clouds and fusing them intelligently using an attention-based mechanism.
